The efficacy of the network to retrieve one of the stored patterns exhibits a phase transition at a finite value of the disorder. The more ordered networks are unable to recover the patterns, and are always attracted to non-symmetric mixture states. Besides, for a range of the number of stored patterns, the efficacy has a maximum at an intermediate value of the disorder. We also give a statistical characterization of the spurious attractors for all values of the disorder of the network.}},

    abstract = {{Despite significant progress in our understanding of the brain at both microscopic and macroscopic scales, the mechanisms by which low-level neuronal behavior gives rise to high-level mental processes such as memory still remain unknown. In this paper, we assess the plausibility and quantify the performance of polychronization, a newly proposed mechanism of neuronal encoding, which has been suggested to underlie a wide range of cognitive phenomena. We then investigate the effect of network topology on the reliability with which input stimuli can be distinguished based on their encoding in the form of so-called polychronous groups or spatiotemporal patterns of spikes. We find that small-world networks perform an order of magnitude better than random ones, enabling reliable discrimination between inputs even when prompted by increasingly incomplete recall cues. Furthermore, we show that small-world architectures operate at significantly reduced energetic costs and that their memory capacity scales favorably with network size. Finally, we find that small-world topologies introduce biologically realistic constraints on the optimal input stimuli, favoring especially the topographic inputs known to exist in many cortical areas. Our results suggest that mammalian cortical networks, by virtue of being both small-world and topographically organized, seem particularly well-suited to information processing through polychronization. This article addresses the fundamental question of encoding in neuroscience. In particular, evidence is presented in support of an emerging model of neuronal encoding in the neocortex based on spatiotemporal patterns of spikes.}},

    abstract = {{Many empirical networks display an inherent tendency to cluster, i.e., to form circles of connected nodes. This feature is typically measured by the clustering coefficient (CC). The CC, originally introduced for binary, undirected graphs, has been recently generalized to weighted, undirected networks. Here we extend the CC to the case of (binary and weighted) directed networks and we compute its expected value for random graphs. We distinguish between CCs that count all directed triangles in the graph (independently of the direction of their edges) and CCs that only consider particular types of directed triangles (e.g., cycles). The main concepts are illustrated by employing empirical data on world-trade flows.}},

@article{Mountcastle1997,
    abstract = {{The modular organization of nervous systems is a widely documented principle of design for both vertebrate and invertebrate brains of which the columnar organization of the neocortex is an example. The classical cytoarchitectural areas of the neocortex are composed of smaller units, local neural circuits repeated iteratively within each area. Modules may vary in cell type and number, in internal and external connectivity, and in mode of neuronal processing between different large entities; within any single large entity they have a basic similarity of internal design and operation. Modules are most commonly grouped into entities by sets of dominating external connections. This unifying factor is most obvious for the heterotypical sensory and motor areas of the neocortex. Columnar defining factors in homotypical areas are generated, in part, within the cortex itself. The set of all modules composing such an entity may be fractionated into different modular subsets by different extrinsic connections. Linkages between them and subsets in other large entities form distributed systems. The neighborhood relations between connected subsets of modules in different entities result in nested distributed systems that serve distributed functions. A cortical area defined in classical cytoarchitectural terms may belong to more than one and sometimes to several distributed systems. Columns in cytoarchitectural areas located at some distance from one another, but with some common properties, may be linked by long-range, intracortical connections.}},

Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon13,14 (popularly known as six degrees of separation15). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.}},

@article{Sporns_Tononi_Edelman_2000,
    abstract = {{Nervous systems facing complex environments have to balance two seemingly opposing requirements. First, there is a need quickly and reliably to extract important features from sensory inputs. This is accomplished by functionally segregated (specialized) sets of neurons, e.g. those found in different cortical areas. Second, there is a need to generate coherent perceptual and cognitive states allowing an organism to respond to objects and events, which represent conjunctions of numerous individual features. This need is accomplished by functional integration of the activity of specialized neurons through their dynamic interactions. These interactions produce patterns of temporal correlations or functional connectivity involving distributed neuronal populations, both within and across cortical areas. Empirical and computational studies suggest that changes in functional connectivity may underlie specific perceptual and cognitive states and involve the integration of information across specialized areas of the brain. The interplay between functional segregation and integration can be quantitatively captured using concepts from statistical information theory, in particular by defining a measure of neural complexity. Complexity measures the extent to which a pattern of functional connectivity produced by units or areas within a neural system combines the dual requirements of functional segregation and integration. We find that specific neuroanatomical motifs are uniquely associated with high levels of complexity and that such motifs are embedded in the pattern of long-range cortico-cortical pathways linking segregated areas of the mammalian cerebral cortex. Our theoretical findings offer new insight into the intricate relationship between connectivity and complexity in the nervous system.}},

    abstract = {{Modern anatomical tracing and imaging techniques are beginning to reveal the structural anatomy of neural circuits at small and large scales in unprecedented detail. When examined with analytic tools from graph theory and network science, neural connectivity exhibits highly non-random features, including high clustering and short path length, as well as modules and highly central hub nodes. These characteristic topological features of neural connections shape non-random dynamic interactions that occur during spontaneous activity or in response to external stimulation. Disturbances of connectivity and thus of neural dynamics are thought to underlie a number of disease states of the brain, and some evidence suggests that degraded functional performance of brain networks may be the outcome of a process of randomization affecting their nodes and edges. This article provides a survey of the non-random structure of neural connectivity, primarily at the large scale of regions and pathways in the mammalian cerebral cortex. In addition, we will discuss how non-random connections can give rise to differentiated and complex patterns of dynamics and information flow. Finally, we will explore the idea that at least some disorders of the nervous system are associated with increased randomness of neural connections.}},

@article{song_etal_2000,
    abstract = {Hebbian models of development and learning require
                  both activity-dependent synaptic plasticity and a
                  mechanism that induces competition between different
                  synapses. One form of experimentally observed
                  long-term synaptic plasticity, which we call
                  spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), depends on
                  the relative timing of pre- and postsynaptic action
                  potentials. In modeling studies, we find that this
                  form of synaptic modification can automatically
                  balance synaptic strengths to make postsynaptic
                  firing irregular but more sensitive to presynaptic
                  spike timing. It has been argued that neurons in
                  vivo operate in such a balanced regime. Synapses
                  modifiable by STDP compete for control of the timing
                  of postsynaptic action potentials. Inputs that fire
                  the postsynaptic neuron with short latency or that
                  act in correlated groups are able to compete most
                  successfully and develop strong synapses, while
                  synapses of longer-latency or less-effective inputs
                  are weakened.},

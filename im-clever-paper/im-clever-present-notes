Active Vision

-Infants explore their environment.

-As they are exploring, infants are learning (evidence: habituation looking time data).

-But, you can abolish learning via e.g. selective lesions (evidence: bachevalier et al, 1993; zeamer et al, 2010).

-Infants STILL demonstrate looking behavior based on visual stimuli.

-Conclusion: the visuomotor system instantiates passive dynamics that
result in the visually-driven looking behavior -- **independent of the reward of learning**

-These circuits' dynamics are the "intrinsic motivation".

-We tried to model these circuits and thus get at the "pure" intrinsic movtivation, unpolluted by learning.

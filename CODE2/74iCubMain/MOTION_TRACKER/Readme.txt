1] main whit the while loops in order to check conf = 0. It works but the main code skips some inputs.
2] main without the while loops. It reads from the ports many times.
Actually implemented: no while loops to check conf = 0. Before to moveleft it reads again from the port in order to avoid that it start to move the neck when it looks for the first time at the other object.

provare a rimettere i while dentro ai thread per un movimento pi√π fluido
